#create a class named triangle

#three attributes names a,b, and c that represent
#the sides of the triangle
#the triangle class will have two methods:
#the init method to initialize the sides
#a method to calculate the perimeter of the triangle from its sides
#the perimeter of the triangle should be printed from outside the class
